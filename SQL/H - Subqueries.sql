--Subquery Exercise
--Use the IQSchool database for this exercise. Each question must use a subquery in its solution.
--**If the questions could also be solved without a subquery, solve it without one as well**
USE [A01-School]
GO

--1. Select the Payment dates and payment amount for all payments that were Cash
SELECT PaymentDate, Amount
FROM   Payment
WHERE  PaymentTypeID = 
    (SELECT PaymentTypeID
     FROM   PaymentType
     WHERE  PaymentTypeDescription = 'cash')
-- Here is the Inner Join version of the above
SELECT PaymentDate, Amount
FROM   Payment P
    INNER JOIN PaymentType PT
            ON PT.PaymentTypeID = P.PaymentTypeID
WHERE  PaymentTypeDescription = 'cash'


--2. Select The Student ID's of all the students that are in the 'Association of Computing Machinery' club
-- TODO: Student Answer Here


--3. Select All the staff full names for staff that have taught a course.
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'Staff'
FROM   Staff
WHERE  StaffID IN -- I used IN because the subquery returns many rows
    (SELECT DISTINCT StaffID FROM Registration)

-- The above can also be done as an INNER JOIN...
SELECT DISTINCT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'Staff'
FROM Staff
    INNER JOIN Registration
        ON Staff.StaffID = Registration.StaffID 


--4. Select All the staff full names that taught DMIT172.
-- TODO: Student Answer Here


--5. Select All the staff full names of staff that have never taught a course
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'Staff'
FROM   Staff
WHERE  StaffID NOT IN -- I used IN because the subquery returns many rows
    (SELECT DISTINCT StaffID FROM Registration)

-- To do the above questions with a JOIN requires that we use an OUTER JOIN...
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'Staff'
FROM   Staff
    LEFT OUTER JOIN Registration
        ON Staff.StaffID = Registration.StaffID
WHERE Registration.StaffID IS NULL

--6. Select the Payment TypeID(s) that have the highest number of Payments made.
-- Explore the counts of payment types, before we try the subquery
SELECT  PaymentTypeID, COUNT(PaymentTypeID) AS 'How many times'
FROM    Payment
GROUP BY PaymentTypeID

-- To get the payment type IDs whose count is greater than or equal to all the others
-- (i.e.: whose count is the highest)
SELECT  PaymentTypeID
FROM    Payment
GROUP BY PaymentTypeID
HAVING COUNT(PaymentTypeID)  >= ALL (SELECT COUNT(PaymentTypeID)
                                     FROM Payment 
                                     GROUP BY PaymentTypeID)

--7. Select the Payment Type Description(s) that have the highest number of Payments made.
SELECT PaymentTypeDescription
FROM   Payment 
    INNER JOIN PaymentType 
        ON Payment.PaymentTypeID = PaymentType.PaymentTypeID
GROUP BY PaymentType.PaymentTypeID, PaymentTypeDescription 
HAVING COUNT(PaymentType.PaymentTypeID) >= ALL (SELECT COUNT(PaymentTypeID)
                                                FROM Payment 
                                                GROUP BY PaymentTypeID)

--8. What is the total avg mark for the students from Edm?
SELECT AVG(Mark) AS 'Average'
FROM   Registration 
WHERE  StudentID IN (SELECT StudentID FROM Student WHERE City = 'Edm')

-- The above results, done as a JOIN instead of a subquery
SELECT AVG(Mark) AS 'Average'
FROM   Registration 
    INNER JOIN Student
        ON Registration.StudentID = Student.StudentID
WHERE City = 'Edm'

--9. What is the avg mark for each of the students from Edm? Display their StudentID and avg(mark)
