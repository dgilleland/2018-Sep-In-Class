-- Update Examples
-- 1. The school thinks it can get a bit more money out of students
--    because of the popularity of a few of its courses. As such,
--    they are increasing the course cost of 'Expert SQL' and 'Quality Assurance'
--    by 10%.
-- SELECT * FROM Course
UPDATE Course
SET    CourseCost = CourseCost * 1.10
WHERE  CourseName IN ('Expert SQL', 'Quality Assurance')
-- Should see 2 rows affected

-- 2. Along with the goals of the school to make more money, they are allowing
--    all courses to have a total of 10 students as the maximum.
UPDATE Course
SET    MaxStudents = 10
-- Notice that because we don't have a WHERE clause, ALL the rows will be affected

-- 3. One of the students has moved and has supplied their new address.
--    Change the address of student 199912010 to 4407-78 Ave, Edmonton, T4Y3P0
-- SELECT * FROM Student WHERE StudentID = 199912010
UPDATE Student
SET    StreetAddress = '4407-78 Ave',
       City = 'Edmonton',
       PostalCode = 'T4Y3P0'
WHERE  StudentID = 199912010

-- 4. Someone in the registrar's office has noticed a bunch of data-entry errors.
--    All the student cities named 'Edm' should be changed to 'Edmonton'
UPDATE Student
SET    City = 'Edmonton'
WHERE  City = 'Edm'
