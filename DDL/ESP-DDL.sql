-- Select the CREATE DATABASE stement below to create the demo database.
-- CREATE DATABASE [ESP-A01]

USE [ESP-A01] -- this is a statement that tells us to switch to a particular database
-- Notice in the database name above, it is "wrapped" in square brackets because 
-- the name had a hypen in it. 
-- For all our other objects (tables, columns, etc), we won't use hypens or spaces, so
-- the use of square brackets are optional.
GO  -- this statement helps to "separate" various DDL statements in our script
    -- so that they are executed as "blocks" of code.

-- To create a database table, we use the CREATE TABLE statement.
-- Note that the order in which we create/drop tables is important
-- because of how the tables are related via Foreign Keys.

/* DROP TABLE statements (to "clean up" the database for re-creation)  */
/*   You should drop tables in the REVERSE order in which you created them */
