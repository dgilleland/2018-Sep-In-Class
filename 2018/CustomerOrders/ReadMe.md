# Customer Orders

The customers of Northwind Traders place their orders by phone or fax. Employees then enter the details of the order into the system via the **Customer Order Form** (from the *Sales* menu item on the website).

The form allows employees to create new orders and view previous orders. Any order whose *Order Date* has been set cannot be modified, because that order has been *"Placed"*.

An order without an Order Date can be modified. It may be an order that is *"In Progress"* (saved, but not placed), or an entirely new order.

The screen mockups in the next sections describe the planned user experience (UX) in working with the form.
